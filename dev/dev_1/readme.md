For dev_1 I think I am going to stick with my previous dev project and build it out with CRUD. I wrote down a few notes on how I plan on tackling it, but I wanted to make sure to run them by you and get your thoughts on it all. I was thinking for some of the input values to go into the form would be a type of character selection, name input for the player, and possibly implementing a player 2 as well. But if sticking with the computer to play against, they would randomly select a character (or you can set it). Then after those selections, I thought it would be cool to add another selection for a field, much like in fighting games. This gives me plenty of data to work with and help manipulate different outcomes for the player. After that you can select however many rounds you'd like to play and go those amount of rounds to determine the winner.
